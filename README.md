# CSE240_Assignment1
Assignment1 for CSE240

This repo is strictly for personal storage. If you find something useful, feel free to use it but not copy it directly.
There are additional basic features added, such as creating a file that has a double space between each output from the while-loop in termination().
Note that part of the assignment was to use scanf(), which seems to be a less than ideal solution in this case.

In order for scanf() to work properly, "\n" was removed from the scanf("%d\n", n); This restricted scanf()
to one line of input.
